# Face-Detection-Haar-Cascade
Object Detection using Haar feature-based cascade classifiers is an effective object detection method. I have implemented this algorithm for face detection in a video. 

By using the many models offered by the Haar Cascade, we can detect many things such as a smile, a face with glasses, license plates, etc.
